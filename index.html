        The worst small town in the Chiba prefecture. The local university is shit and
        will not give you any of the correct information you need to register for classes
        properly. Local train line has a grand total of 5 stations, meaning that if you
        want to escape, you WILL have to change trains at least once, twice if you want to
        get to Tokyo, unless you take a specific early train.

        Most of the buldings in Togane and the surrounding areas are old and creepy. AND
        STILL IN USE. The only things older than the buidings are the inhabitants, who
        seem to average around 75 years of age. They congregate at the local shopping mall
        before it opens and stay there until the evening.

        The rest of Japan has all the sights you could want! Meanwhile, Togane has shitty
        buildings and the only point of (mild) interest is that there are plenty of
        izakayas within a short distance from the train station in case you need to get
        blackout drunk to forget how crap Togane is before you leave (starting at only
        2700¥ for 2 hrs of 飲み放題!(drink all you want(requires purchase of at least one
        food item in addition to payment for the seating and the 飲み放題 course
        itself))).
